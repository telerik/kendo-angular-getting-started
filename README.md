# Getting Started with Kendo UI for Angular

This project is part of the [Getting Started guide](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/getting-started/) in the [Kendo UI for Angular documentation](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/). The app was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
